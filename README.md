# JobApplicationTracker - IN PROGRESS

I've been exploring new career opportunities for a while now. 
While the process has introduced me to many great people and 
interesting roles, finding the perfect fit is rarely straightforward. 
Between cultural alignment, seniority, expectations, or location, job 
hunting can certainly be a tedious journey.

Turns out, just flinging resumes into the void wasn't cutting it. 
To tame the beast that is job searching, I became a spreadsheet sorcerer, 
conjuring order out of chaos with the magic of Google Sheets.

My inner data-nerd demanded to know the ins and outs of my job search. 
I wasn't content just sending resumes into the void; I needed to log application dates,
reply turnaround times, and dissect every interview. What were the highlights? 
The lowlights? Their must-haves? My deal-breakers?

Given my passion for organization and a soft spot for complicated spreadsheet formulas,
it was only a matter of time before I conjured up a detailed workbook. 
What began as my personal job hunt HQ soon transformed into a slick template, 
perfect for taming the chaos of applications.

I quickly realized I needed scripts to truly manage my job hunt. Manual data entry, especially for interviews, was a non-starter. My first solution was a Google Script that turned an input sheet into a simple data entry form. It did the job, but I craved more.

This sparked an idea: why not build my own app? I know there are many out there, but this felt like the perfect project to unleash my inner developer. I've built something that lets me:

Effortlessly add new job opportunities, including all the key details.

Adjust application statuses on the fly.

Automatically create detailed interview logs, complete with meeting times, attendees, and my own reflections.

Monitor my progress with personalized KPIs.

I'm keen to hear any feedback on how I can make this even better. And to my developer friends, don't hold back too much! (Just kidding... mostly!)
